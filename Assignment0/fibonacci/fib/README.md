# Unit Test Starter

Fib.py has been provided which has 2 ways of generating fibonacci numbers. Your assignment is to ensure these 2 ways have sufficient unit test coverage.

## Getting Started Steps

- running "make setup" will install correct dependencies and check for correct python version (3.7+)
- running "make clean" will clean the project by removing all "pycache" folders and files
- running "make format will run autopep8 and docformatter to auto format the code
- running "make style" will run a lint checker on your code
- running "make test" or "make" will run all unit tests that have been created
- running "make coverage" will run all unit tests and give you a code coverage report
- running "make runner" will run a script to calculate time and memory for the Array class

# Fib

## Requirements

- You must not modify fib.py
- You must generate at least 2 unit tests for fib.py
- Must get a 10/10 when running "make style"
- Your unit tests must reach 100% code coverage

## Interface

- Use fib.py

## Tests

- test small and large fibonacci sequences

## Corner Cases

- What happens when no number is passed in (i.e. None)

## Library

You can only use basic python libraries (no special imports).
